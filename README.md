# AI Health Assessment

**Healht Ai assesment.**

## Overview

AI Health Assessment is a project exploring how artificial intelligence can assist in preliminary healthcare assessments. Users provide their initial health concern, and the AI interacts by asking targeted follow-up questions based on previous answers. Once the questionnaire is complete, the system generates a comprehensive report including:

- **Diagnosis:** AI-generated preliminary diagnosis
- **Medications:** Suggested medications (for demonstration only)
- **Follow-Up:** Recommendations for additional actions or appointments
- **Treatment Plan:** AI-suggested plan based on assessment

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. Do not use the generated report for medical decisions without consulting a qualified doctor.
